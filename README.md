Image-to-Image Translation Model with cGAN
This repository contains the implementation of an image-to-image translation model using a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) called Pix2Pix. The model is capable of transforming images from one domain to another, such as turning sketches into photos or black-and-white images into color images.

Introduction
Pix2Pix is a type of conditional GAN that learns a mapping from input images to output images. This implementation uses a U-Net generator and a PatchGAN discriminator to perform tasks like image colorization, style transfer, and more.

Features
Image-to-Image Translation
Support for multiple tasks (e.g., sketches to photos, day to night)
Configurable training parameters
Visualization of training progress
Requirements
Python 3.7+
TensorFlow 2.0+
NumPy
Matplotlib
Installation
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/pix2pix-image-translation.git
cd pix2pix-image-translation
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Preprocessing
Prepare your dataset by organizing it into two folders: one for the input images and one for the target images.

Training
To train the Pix2Pix model, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python train.py --data_dir ./path_to_your_data --epochs 200 --batch_size 1
Testing
To generate translated images using a pre-trained model, run:

bash
Copy code
python test.py --data_dir ./path_to_your_test_data --model_path ./path_to_your_model
Training
The train.py script handles the training of the Pix2Pix model. You can configure various parameters such as the number of epochs, batch size, learning rate, and more through command-line arguments.

bash
Copy code
usage: train.py [-h] --data_dir DATA_DIR [--epochs EPOCHS] [--batch_size BATCH_SIZE] [--learning_rate LEARNING_RATE]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --data_dir DATA_DIR   Directory containing the training data
  --epochs EPOCHS       Number of training epochs (default: 200)
  --batch_size BATCH_SIZE
                        Batch size (default: 1)
  --learning_rate LEARNING_RATE
                        Learning rate (default: 0.0002)
Results
The results of the trained Pix2Pix model will be saved in the results directory. This will include generated images, as well as training loss and accuracy plots.
